This project utilizes Uber and NYC yellow taxi rides data from Jan 2020 to Aug 2024 along with the weather data for the same period to explore ride patterns and factors that could have affected rides. The implementation includes data downloading, cleaning and sampling, storing data in SQLite database, and creating visualizations. The analysis aims to observe ride patterns and explore areas including how weather impacts rides and tips, and driver's monthly earnings breakdown, etc.
